# StrongAppProject
This is my attempt to recreate, from scratch, the page strongapp.io/.  
This app is one of my new favorite workout recording apps to use so I thought it would be a fun way to put some of my new HTML/CSS
knowledge to the test!  It's not perfect, as you can see I obviously have issues with scaling for different resolutions, but I see
it as a work in progress.  As I learn more, I will add and adjust this project.
Update: Looks like I solved the scaling problems!  It seems like I need to get away from using percentages when determining the size of boxes.
